# ChatGPT Prompt Template for Reddit Data Extractor

Paste this before any `.md` file generated by the Reddit Data Extractor extension.

---

You are given a Reddit post exported to Markdown with these sections:

- **YAML front-matter** (title, subreddit, author, timestamps, URLs, post_id)  
- **Post body** (may be empty)  
- **Images** (list of associated media URLs)  
- **Extracted Mentions** (Links, Files/Paths, CLI Flags, Config key=value)  
- **Comments** (nested, with “(N more replies not fetched)” markers)  
- **Fetch Diagnostics** (comment counts, placeholders, domains, endpoint, HTTP status)

---

## Rules

1. **Source integrity**  
   - If Fetch Diagnostics shows non-200, missing OK, or 0 comments processed → treat comments as unreliable.  
   - In that case, rely only on front-matter, Post body, and Extracted Mentions.  

2. **Prioritize content in this order**  
   1. Front-matter fields (title, subreddit, author, created_iso, URLs)  
   2. Structured data in Extracted Mentions (links, config lines, file paths, flags)  
   3. Top-level comments that:  
      - Are by the OP, OR  
      - Contain concrete steps, data, or references, OR  
      - Have credible upvotes (≥5) and reproducible info  

3. **Ignore distractions**  
   - Off-topic or speculative comments  
   - Opinion-only replies, memes, arguments, platform wars  
   - Nested chains deeper than 2 levels unless they directly support a kept top-level comment  

4. **Handling claims**  
   - Quote structured values (links, config lines, flags) exactly  
   - Tie every actionable claim to a source: (front-matter, OP, comment by u/NAME, or link DOMAIN)  

---

## Deliverables

Return the following sections:

### Summary
3–6 bullet points with only actionable facts.

### Procedure
Step-by-step instructions if applicable (paths, code blocks, config values, or clear ordered steps).

### Caveats
Bullets covering risks, blockers, limitations, or gotchas.

### Sources
Short list mapping each claim to its origin (e.g. OP front-matter, u/NAME, example.com).

---

## Variants

- **Structured JSON output** (for ingest):  
Return JSON with `title`, `created_iso`, `op`, `primary_links`, `config_or_data`, `steps`, `constraints`, `diagnostics`.

- **Decision mode** (should I do this?):  
Return: Pros (max 3), Cons/Risks (max 3), Preconditions, Go/No-Go with rationale.
